# Swift Functional Programming
This repo is the iOS example project in the book "Swift Functional Programming" by Dr. Fatih Nayebi.

I have made minor modifications here and there to satisfy the requirements of new versions of Alamofire and such.
Also, I have changed some aspects of the book's example to better fit community-based Swift guidelines of style and best practices.

# Building
This project has Cocoapod dependencies, so please run `$ pod install` and open the xcworkspace.
